# BlockFrost-lean

A Lean library for interacting with the [Blockfrost API](https://blockfrost.io/).

This library provides a typed interface to the Blockfrost API, making it easy to build decentralized applications on the Cardano blockchain with the safety and correctness of the Lean programming language.

Except the POST methods, which are not yet implemented.
